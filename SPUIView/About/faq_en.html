	<div id="content_q"><a name="question1"></a>Q：1.What Is the Content of the Video Test?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		At present, popular video websites outside China are YouTube and Netflix. However, the test can be conducted for YouTube videos only because YouTube provides open interfaces to satisfy requirements of video playback not on YouTube. Netflix's open interfaces have not been found up to the present. Moreover, Netflix encrypts its videos. The cracking solution has not been found.</div>
	<div id="content_a1">
	1. The PC professional edition supports the source testing for all YouTube videos whose definition is 4K (2016P), 2K (1440P), 1080P, or lower.</div>
	<div id="content_a1">
	2. The APP edition only supports the source testing for videos whose definition is 1080P or lower, as YouTube players do not support playback of videos whose definition is above 1080P on mobile phones.</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		In China, video sources are cracked by using third-party components. Cracking succeed rates are different on different websites. Youku and iQIY, which are the most popular websites at present and whose video cracking succeed rates are high, are selected. Adaption for other websites is in progress.</div>
	<div id="content_a1">
	1. The PC professional edition supports the source testing for all videos for non-members of Youku and iQIY whose definition is 1080P or lower.</div>
	<div id="content_a1">
	2. The APP edition only supports the source testing for Youku videos whose definition is 1080P or lower. There is no planning for iQIY video source testing temporarily.</div>
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question2"></a>Q：2.What Is the Content of the Web Test?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		Global top 100 websites have been embedded in the PC professional edition for the web test. You can also manually add websites or import the template to conduct the test for other websites.</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		Mainstream websites have been embedded in the APP edition for the web test. In China, the web test is conducted for Taobao, JD, hao123, and Sohu. Outside China, the web test is conducted for Google.</div>
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question3"></a>Q：3.How Is the U-vMOS Score Calculated?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		According to the U-vMOS calculation method, the highest score of 4K and 1080P video sources is 4.78 and 4.25, respectively. Interaction and viewing are score deduction items. If the initial buffering time lasts more than 8s or the video freeze duration lasts more than 9s, the overall U-vMOS score will be low.</div>
	
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question4"></a>Q：4.How Can Video Experience Be Rated over Four Points?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		The highest score for 4K video sources is 4.78. If a user views a 8K video source on a screen with the size of less than 42 inches, the initial buffering time is less than 100 ms, and no video freeze occurs during viewing, the video experience can be rated five points.</div>
	
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question5"></a>Q：5.How Can a Low U-vMOS Score Indicate a Network Issue Because It May Be Caused by an Incapable Video Source Server or Poor Wi-Fi Access Effect?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		A lower U-vMOS score indicates that the current network needs to be optimized to better support 4L video viewing. Professional services can be used to demarcate and locate faults.
		</div>
	
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question6"></a>Q：6.Whether Is a Netflix U-vMOS Test Supported?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		No, because the Netflix uses the high-bandwidth digital content protection (HDCP) technology.</div>
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question7"></a>Q：7.Why Does a Single U-vMOS Item Have a High Score but the Overall Score Is Low?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		The overall U-vMOS score is calculated by deducting scores based on sQuality. The scores to be deducted are subject to sInteraction and sView scores.Score deduction may be caused in the following scenarios:</div>
	<div id="content_a1">
	1.	Poor video source quality: If the sInteraction or sView score does not meet requirements, a low U-vMOS score will be generated. When the playback time is 2 minutes, sQuality is 3.82. The video freeze occurs once every three seconds, and the sView score is 2.52 points. The initial buffering time is 100 ms, and the sInteraction score is 5 points. The overall U-vMOS score is 2.77 points.</div>
	<div id="content_a1">
	2.	Good video source quality: If both the sInteraction and sView score do not meet requirements, a low U-vMOS score will be generated. When the playback time is 2 minutes, sQuality is 4.55. The video freeze occurs once every three seconds, and the sView score is 2.52 points. The initial buffering time is 800 ms, and the sInteraction score is 4.16 points. The overall U-vMOS score is 2.88 points.</div>
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question8"></a>Q：8.What Causes the U-vMOS Score to Be --?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		Possible causes:</div>
	<div id="content_a1">
	1.	Network conditions are poor and the video playback time is 0.</div>
	<div id="content_a1">
	2.	Both the video frame rate and bit rate are 0. For videos from websites such as YouTube, if the frame rate and bit rate are not specified, that is, the default value 0 is used, the tool will query the related information on the related website. If no data is queried, the U-vMOS calculation will also fail.</div>
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question9"></a>Q：9.Video Test Results Show That Video Freezes Occur Frequently. However, the sView Score Is Not Low. Why?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		U-vMOS algorithm does not cover video freezes that last for not more than 100 ms. However, the SpeedPro covers these video freezes in calculation. This is why the sView score is not low (video freezes influence the sView score) when test results show that video freezes occur frequently.</div>
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question10"></a>Q：10.Why Is the Screen Size Set to 42 Inches for SpeedPro? What Results Will Be Caused If the Screen Size Is Modified?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		42 inches is the minimum screen size required for 4K video playing. The purpose of setting the default screen size to 42 inches is to accurately simulate actual video playing scenarios.</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		If the screen size is set to be higher, requirements for video definition become higher. For example, when a 360P video is played on a 42-inch screen, images are amplified. As a result, images become blurry. As a result, the sQuality score of U-vMOS becomes small.</div>
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question11"></a>Q：11.What Is the Maximum U-vMOS Value for Videos with Different Definitions Played on a 42-Inch Screen?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		
		<div id="content_a"> <table> <tr><td>Definition</td><td>Maximum U-vMOS Value</td></tr> <tr><td>4K（2160P）</td><td>4.75</td></tr> <tr><td>2K（1440P）</td><td>4.67</td></tr> <tr><td>1080P</td><td>4.54</td></tr> <tr><td>720P</td><td>4.15</td></tr> <tr><td>480P</td><td>2.69</td></tr> <tr><td>360P</td><td>2.02</td></tr> </table></div>
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question12"></a>Q：12.What Is the Difference Between the SpeedVideo and SpeedPro?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		Currently, SpeedVideo can test only videos, while SpeedPro can test videos, web pages, and bandwidth, which better supports Fixed Network services. SpeedPro has mobile and PC versions. Mobile SpeedPro is used to trigger customer interests in NC, and PC SpeedPro is used to collect video experience data in NC.</div>	
		<div id="content_a">
		The SpeedVideo supports the test of videos on mobile phones. By setting the minimum screen size (42 inches) for 4K video playing, SpeedPro can simulate viewing of videos with different definitions on TV screens for U-vMOS scoring.</div>	
		<div id="content_a">
		PC SpeedPro collects diversified experience indicators by supporting manual parameter setting and customization of periodical collection parameters and outputs the detailed experience analysis result based on U-vMOS values.</div>	
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question13"></a>Q：13.(Mobile SpeedPro) Why Does Mobile SpeedPro Not Support 4K Video Source Testing?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		The test result indicates that the current smartphones with the best performance do not support 4K video playback.</div>		
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question14"></a>Q：14.(Mobile SpeedPro) Where Are Video Sources Involved in SpeedPro App Dialing Tests Located?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		SpeedPro App simulates YouTube or Youku client behaviors. A video source is subject to the smartphone location. The CDN scheduling server can automatically calculate the video source location based on the smartphone access location.</div>		
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question15"></a>Q：15.(Mobile SpeedPro) Where are Bandwidth Test Servers Deployed?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		SpeedTest global resources are used. Specifically, a server closest to a smartphone is used, and a test is preferentially performed using a carrier's server. Alternatively, you can manually specify a server for testing on the setting page.</div>	
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question16"></a>Q：16.(Mobile SpeedPro) Why Do Bandwidth Test Results Vary with Smartphones such as Honor 6 and Mate8?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		A bandwidth test result is affected by many factors, including a smartphone performance such as WI-FI module processing performance and CPU handling performance.</div>	
	<div id="content_q"><a name="question17"></a>Q：17.Why does an instantaneous burst value occur in the first few seconds of a real-time upload/download rate test?</div>

		<div id="content_a_a">A：</div>
		<div id="content_a">
		The SpeedPro bandwidth test principle is the same with that of SpeedTest. Generating an instantaneous burst value is normal, which is displayed in the real-time test result. However, SpeedPro will handle the instantaneous burst value based on algorithms in the final test result to ensure test accuracy.</div>
